# Folder Creation and Moving

Ensure you have the module "NTFSSecurity" installed.

## Step0AddUsersToGroup.ps1

This adds all users to the group used in the next script.


## Step1AddNewUser.ps1

This script builds the folders for all new users as well as archive folders. This also creates the first "Week Ending" Folder.

## Step2MoveFolder.ps1

This Script moves all folders to the Archive labeled "Week Ending xx-xx-xxxx" once the 7th week of folders has been created.

## Step 3 coming soon.
